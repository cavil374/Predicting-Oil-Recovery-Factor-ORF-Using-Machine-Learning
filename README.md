# Predicting-Oil-Recovery-Factor-ORF-Using-Machine-Learning
This report presents a data-driven approach to predict the oil recovery factor (ORF) using machine learning. ORF measures the recoverable oil from a reservoir and impacts extraction efficiency and profitability. Traditional methods are costly and data-intensive, so ML offers early-stage, reliable ORF estimates to support decisions.
